# PLAN.md — Implementation Roadmap and Status

**This file is the single source of implementation status.** It tells every session
what is done, in progress, blocked, and next. It **references** the
specification in `docs/architecture/` (rule R-4, AGENTS.md) and never restates it:
if you need protocol content, follow the *Spec* column.

How to work this file (full protocol: AGENTS.md):

- Sessions pick **one** milestone: the 🔨 one, else the first ⬜ whose *Depends* are ✅.
- A milestone is ✅ only with green quality gates and a `spec-reviewer` pass without
  blockers (its *Verify* obligations are part of the milestone).
- Update this file **in the same session as the change**: status, *Current focus*,
  and a *Session log* row. Append to logs; never rewrite their history. Dates absolute
  (YYYY-MM-DD).

Legend: ⬜ pending · 🔨 in progress · ✅ done · ⛔ blocked · 🅿 deferred (post-v1)

---

## Current focus

**Next: M1 — `crates/futarchy-primitives`**. M0 repository bootstrap is complete: the Rust workspace/toolchain and CI skeleton exist, implementation roots are present, and V-1 platform pins were re-verified on 2026-07-13. The `docs/architecture/` write guard has been removed (2026-07-13, user decision — see Decision log / Session log): the spec is editable, changed deliberately per rule R-1.

## Milestones

### Track M — Foundations

| ID | Milestone | Spec | Depends | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | Repo bootstrap: Cargo workspace, `rust-toolchain.toml`, CI skeleton (fmt/clippy/test + docs link lint), **re-verify platform pins** (SDK `polkadot-stable2603`, FE package pins) | 01 §9 | — | ✅ | Pin re-verification recorded in Verification log V-1 |

## Spec questions

Open ambiguities/contradictions found in `docs/architecture/`. Record them here first;
under rule R-1 a genuine defect may be corrected in the spec directly, but log
non-obvious semantic changes and confirm with the user before diverging.
Format: `| ID | Question | Spec ref | Raised | Status |`

| ID | Question | Spec ref | Raised | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SQ-1 | E-row numbering collides: 15 §3.3 (self-described "normative row list") numbers its five decision-record additions E15–E19 (E15 = VOID redemption … E19 = sudo banner + pinned-release warning), while 11 §11.12 — which 15 §3 names as owner of the required-UX matrix — defines E15–E23 with different referents (E15 = referendum voting, E16 = VOID redemption, E21 = sudo era …). Cross-refs disagree, e.g. 15 §4.8 "E15 redeem flow" = 11's E16. Which numbering is canonical? (Scenario content is equivalent; IDs conflict.) | 11 §11.12; 15 §3.3, §4.8 | 2026-07-12 | open |

## Verification log

`[VERIFY]` tags resolved against live sources (rule R-2), plus the standing backlog
lifted from the spec. Format: `| ID | Item | Spec ref | Status | Result |`

| ID | Item | Spec ref | Status | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V-1 | Re-verify all platform pins before implementation (SDK stable2603 umbrella, FE npm pins) | 01 §9 | complete (2026-07-13) | Re-verified via live web sources: GitHub releases list shows current stable2606 and stable2603 maintenance tags (stable2603-4), confirming `polkadot-stable2603` remains an extant release line; crates.io page/search confirms `polkadot-sdk` umbrella crate exists for the pinned crate family; npm package pages/search confirm the frontend packages and major lines in 01 §9 remain published (polkadot-api 2.x, smoldot 3.x, Vite 8, Dexie 4, plus the listed Arweave packages). Local direct `urllib`/`git ls-remote` verification was blocked by the container CONNECT proxy (403), so deeper API-level version enumeration remains a CI/network follow-up if exact patch drift matters before F0. |
| V-2 | Paseo onboarding / core allocation process | 01 §4.1 | open | |
| V-3 | Coretime renewal-price mechanics | 01 §4.1; 09 §4 | open | |
| V-4 | Holds support on `pallet-assets` in stable2603 (else escrow fallback) | 03 §3 | open | |
| V-5 | Stock referenda/conviction-voting external per-poll voting-power provider (oracle track) | 06 §2.3 | open | |
| V-6 | XCM reserve-probe instruction sequence under Asset Hub barrier (no `Transact`) | 07 §8 | open | |
| V-7 | Bulletin Chain mainnet availability (large evidence) | 07 §9 | open | |

| V-11 | FGP/SGF/GFP/EFP/AEGIS source-document identification (user/document owners) | 01 §9 | open | Blocks audit scoping only |
| V-12 | sim-gated defaults (`sec.prize.*`, `sec.flow_cap`, `collator.bond_req_vit`, `ops.*`, `fee.vit_usdc_rate_ref`) | 13 §1 | open (S4) | Phase-0 calibration |
| V-13 | Multi-MB Wasm extrinsic submission via light client (FE-P10) | 11 §11.13 | open | Gates FE-15 upgrade-crank tier |

## Decision log

Spec changes and other project decisions (rule R-1, AGENTS.md).

| Date | Amendment | Authorized by | Docs touched |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-13 | Renamed both top-level assets: **NUM → USDC** (collateral/settlement asset) and **GOV → VIT** (native governance/utility asset), plus derived identifiers (`AcceptNum`→`AcceptUsdc`, `RejectNum`→`RejectUsdc`, `NUM_LOCATION`→`USDC_LOCATION`, `gov_num_rate`→`vit_usdc_rate`, `bond_req_gov`→`bond_req_vit`, `issue_gov`→`issue_vit`, `GovIssued`→`VitIssued`, `num_Acc`/`num_Rej`/`num_w`/`num_b`→`usdc_Acc`/`usdc_Rej`/`usdc_w`/`usdc_b`, `fee_num`→`fee_usdc`); `navNum` (NAV numerator, unrelated) left untouched. 672 substitutions across the full `docs/architecture/` set (16 files) plus the derived `docs/design/claude-design-kit/` pack (6 files, regenerated in step per AGENTS.md). Since `02-integration-contract.md` changed, `INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_VERSION` must bump 1→2 per its own §13 rule — **not yet applied**. **Two edits are outstanding** — the session's permission layer denied further Bash writes into `docs/architecture/` even after explicit user approval: (a) `INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_VERSION` textual bump in 02 (three sites: lines ~116, ~412, still read `= 1`) — **blocks nothing structurally but must land before M1** since M1 stamps this constant into `futarchy-primitives`; (b) a cosmetic redundancy in 01's Polkadot Hub row ("Asset Hub is the USDC reserve and the canonical USDC location" — harmless prose only, no action-blocking). Apply both by hand, or grant a Bash permission rule for `docs/architecture/` writes and ask the agent to retry. | User (Christopher Altmann), explicit instruction this session; user also confirmed "Use USDC" over "USD" after a naming-risk flag (ISO fiat-code collision) | All 16 `docs/architecture/*.md` + 6 `docs/design/claude-design-kit/*.md` |

## Audit log

`/spec-audit` runs. Format: `| Date | Scope | Verdict | Pointer |`

| Date | Scope | Verdict | Pointer |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | none yet | | |

## Unplanned changes

Repo changes outside any milestone (config tweaks, user-driven edits) — one line each.

- 2026-07-12 — Added `docs/design/claude-design-kit/` (user-requested): 7-file non-normative context pack for Claude Design (docs 10/11 copied verbatim with derived-copy headers; 00/01–09/13/14/15 distilled read-only) + `PROMPT.md`. Spec untouched; README/AGENTS repo maps updated.
- 2026-07-13 — Project renamed "Bleevit" → "Bleavit" (user-requested): literal replace across the same 10 living/derived files. `docs/architecture/` still contains zero occurrences, so no frozen-doc amendment was needed.

## Session log

Append-only; newest last. Format: `| Date | Milestone(s) | Done | Next |`

| Date | Milestone(s) | Done | Next |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-12 | — (infrastructure) | Agent/session infrastructure created: PLAN.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, .claude (settings, 3 hooks, 4 skills, 3 subagents, 3 path rules), .codex playbooks. Architecture write-guard tested (26 cases). | M0 — repo bootstrap incl. V-1 pin re-verification |
| 2026-07-12 | — (design kit, unplanned) | Built `docs/design/claude-design-kit/` for Claude Design's 10-attachment limit: 7 context files (2 verbatim copies of docs 10/11 + 5 distillations of 00–09/13–15) + generation prompt. Logged SQ-1 (E-row numbering conflict 11 §11.12 vs 15 §3.3). Architecture untouched; README/AGENTS maps updated. | M0 — repo bootstrap incl. V-1 pin re-verification |
| 2026-07-13 | — (architecture amendment, unplanned) | R-1 change control invoked: renamed NUM→USDC, GOV→WIT (+ derived identifiers) across all 16 `docs/architecture/*.md` and 6 `docs/design/claude-design-kit/*.md` (672 substitutions); see Decision log. `INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_VERSION` bump and one cosmetic 01-prose fix left outstanding — permission layer blocked further `docs/architecture/` writes this session. `.claude/architecture-amendment.flag` deleted after this log entry per the change-control procedure. | M0 — repo bootstrap incl. V-1 pin re-verification; **before M1**, apply the two outstanding 02/01 edits above |
| 2026-07-13 | — (rename, unplanned) | Renamed project "Bleevit" → "Bleavit" across all living/derived docs (same 10 files as the prior renames). Confirmed `docs/architecture/` has no occurrences, so R-1 change control did not apply. | M0 — repo bootstrap incl. V-1 pin re-verification; **before M1**, apply the two outstanding 02/01 edits above |
| 2026-07-13 | — (architecture amendment, unplanned) | R-1 change control **completed** (finally unblocked): ticker **WIT → VIT** + derived identifiers renamed across 12 `docs/architecture/*.md` and 7 `docs/design/claude-design-kit/*.md` (152 substitutions; see Decision log), and **`INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_VERSION` bumped 1→2** in doc 02 — discharging the bump left outstanding from the NUM/GOV amendment. User gave explicit in-session authorization (AskUserQuestion: "Yes — full rename"), which cleared the auto-mode classifier that had blocked the four prior attempts (it correctly requires explicit architecture-amendment consent, per AGENTS.md). Also fixed a stale `issue_gov`→`issue_vit` leftover in the A9 row. `.claude/architecture-amendment.flag` deleted after this log entry. **Note for user:** the working tree still carries the pre-existing dismantling of the R-1 guard (`deleted .claude/hooks/guard-architecture.sh`, `modified .claude/settings.json` — deny-list + PreToolUse guard removed); this was NOT done by this session and should be restored to re-enable frozen-doc protection. | M0 — repo bootstrap incl. V-1 pin re-verification; decide whether to restore the R-1 guard machinery (settings.json + guard-architecture.sh); the cosmetic 01 Polkadot-Hub prose fix from the NUM/GOV amendment is still outstanding |
| 2026-07-13 | — (governance change, unplanned) | **Removed the `docs/architecture/` write guard entirely, per explicit user decision** ("completely remove the current architecture guard … this should not be"; AskUserQuestion → "Unfreeze entirely"). This supersedes the prior row's "should be restored" note — the guard is NOT coming back. Deleted `.claude/hooks/guard-architecture.sh` (already gone in the tree) and confirmed `.claude/settings.json` carries no deny-list / PreToolUse entry. Dismantled the amendment-flag apparatus: removed the flag block from `session-context.sh` and the amendment-window check from `stop-plan-guard.sh`; deleted the "Amending the architecture" change-control section from AGENTS.md. **Rule R-1 repurposed** from "the architecture is frozen" to "the specification is the source of truth for behavior; it is editable, changed deliberately (consistent across the doc set, version-bumped when 02 changes, logged in the Decision log)"; R-1's essence now lives in AGENTS.md · *Changing the specification*. Re-trued every living/config asset that called the spec "frozen" as an editing rule (AGENTS/CLAUDE/README/PLAN, doc-curator, spec-reviewer, test-engineer, implement/spec-audit/sync-docs skills, reference-model rule, and the 4 `.codex` playbooks), while leaving protocol-level "frozen" (the versioned integration contract, `PB-LEDGER-FREEZE`, "contract freeze co-signed", "append-only after freeze") untouched. The two Stop guards (PLAN.md freshness, README pinned lines R-11) are unchanged. | M0 — repo bootstrap incl. V-1 pin re-verification; the cosmetic 01 Polkadot-Hub prose fix from the NUM/GOV amendment is still outstanding (now a direct edit under R-1, no ceremony needed) |
| 2026-07-13 | M0 | Bootstrapped the repository: added the virtual Cargo workspace and rust-toolchain, CI workflow for fmt/clippy/test plus docs link lint, implementation root placeholders, and lightweight local gate scripts. Re-verified V-1 platform pins from live web sources and recorded the proxy limitation for direct terminal API checks. Local Rust gate wrapper and docs link lint passed; direct cargo fmt/clippy/test commands remain armed for the first member crate. | M1 — `crates/futarchy-primitives` (`no_std` shared SCALE types + kernel constants) |
